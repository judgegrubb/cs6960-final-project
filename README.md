## MY PIECES

For my final project I implemented the [bonus hw](http://panda.moyix.net/~moyix/cs3224/fall16/bonus_hw/bonus_hw.html) of Brendan Dolan-Gavitt's
OS class at NYU.

I modified the Makefile, console.c, defs.h, main.c, trap.c and traps.h.

I also added the mouse.c. The bulk of my code exists in console.c and mouse.c.

This project runs with a standard `make qemu`. `make qemu-nox` doesn't provide
the needed interface for using the mouse driver.

## ORIGINAL XV6 README

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

## ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.828, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

## BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries. See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/tools.html.
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
